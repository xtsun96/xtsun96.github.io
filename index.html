									<h2>About Me</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									My research interests centre around FinTech, with a particular focus on Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO). Currently, I am studying the intricacies of governance centralization within DAOs and examining financial risks in DeFi.
Additionally, I am passionate about business practices in the DeFi space and exploring opportunities to incubate DeFi projects. If you are interested in potential collaboration in these areas, please feel free to contact me.
